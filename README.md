This ATM project is a Java-based console application designed to simulate real banking operations using Object-Oriented Programming principles. It includes essential features such as account login, PIN verification, balance inquiry, deposit, withdrawal, and transaction history. The system uses classes like Account, Bank, ATM, and Transaction to demonstrate encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Through this project, users can understand how financial transactions are processed and recorded internally. It also teaches how data flows between different components of a banking system, making it an excellent project for learning structured programming and real-world application design.
